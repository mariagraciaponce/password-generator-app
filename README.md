### What I learned

I learned that you cand add an SVG directly inline and style afterwards on CSS. I also learned the importance of selecting the right input types so the slider and the checkboxes actually work, the styling is a little bit tricky that way but it is worth it so that you don't have to use a lot of JS to make it work.

JS is still really hard, eveytime I think I know how to do something a new variable has to be created and I loose track all over again.
I asked a lot of questions to ChatGPT and in a way I feel like I'm being smart for using the technology in my favor but I also feel like I'm cheating so I don`t know.
